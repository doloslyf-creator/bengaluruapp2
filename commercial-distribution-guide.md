# Commercial Distribution Guide - OwnItRight Platform

## Overview
This guide explains how to distribute and deploy the OwnItRight platform for commercial buyers, including automated Supabase setup for seamless onboarding.

## Distribution Methods

### 1. One-Click Deploy Platforms

#### Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Add to your repository root
# vercel.json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "SETUP_MODE": "auto"
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  },
  "functions": {
    "server/index.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Netlify Deployment
```toml
# netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  SETUP_MODE = "auto"
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/server/:splat"
  status = 200
```

#### Railway Deployment
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

### 2. Docker Distribution

Create a Docker container for easy deployment:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Expose port
EXPOSE 5000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/setup/status || exit 1

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 3. Manual Installation

Provide buyers with this installation script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install.sh

echo "Installing OwnItRight Platform..."

# Check if Node.js is installed
if ! command -v node &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Node.js is required. Please install Node.js 18+ first."
    exit 1
fi

# Clone repository (replace with your actual repo)
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ownitright-platform.git
cd ownitright-platform

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm run dev

echo "Installation complete! Please visit http://localhost:5000/setup to configure your platform."
```

## Automated Setup Process

### How It Works

1. **First Launch Detection**: When the application starts, it checks for required environment variables
2. **Setup Redirect**: If setup is needed, users are automatically redirected to `/setup`
3. **Credential Collection**: Users provide their Supabase project URL and service role key
4. **Automated Configuration**: The system:
   - Validates the Supabase connection
   - Creates all required database tables and schemas
   - Seeds initial data (zones, settings, etc.)
   - Saves configuration securely
5. **Ready to Use**: Platform is immediately ready for use

### Setup Flow for Buyers

    A[Deploy Platform] --> B[First Launch]
    B --> C{Setup Required?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Redirect to /setup]
    C -->|No| E[Go to Dashboard]
    D --> F[Enter Supabase Credentials]
    F --> G[Validate Connection]
    G --> H[Create Database Schema]
    H --> I[Seed Initial Data]
    I --> J[Save Configuration]
    J --> K[Setup Complete]
    K --> E[Go to Dashboard]
```

## Environment Variables
