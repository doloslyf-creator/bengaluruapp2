# OwnItRight - Property Management Dashboard

## Overview
OwnItRight is a comprehensive full-stack platform for property management and customer discovery, specifically tailored for the Indian real estate market. It integrates an admin property management system with a customer-facing property finder, facilitating property search, site visit bookings, and consultation requests. Key capabilities include real-time data integration, RERA compliance features, zoning information, regional categorization, a legal due diligence tracker, and professional property valuation reports. The platform aims to provide a seamless and transparent experience for both property managers and prospective buyers, enhancing efficiency and trust in real estate transactions.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project approach: User appreciates comprehensive solutions that integrate real data with sophisticated customer experience.
Focus areas: Customer-facing features, real data integration, and seamless user workflows.
UI Design preferences: Clean, minimal design without unnecessary panels or borders. Prefer simple layouts that encourage clicking to view details rather than multiple action buttons. Match labels should be displayed in brackets at the top of cards. Strongly prefers compact, table-based interfaces over verbose card layouts for admin panels - values data density and efficiency.
Messaging preference: Personalized messaging that makes customers "feel us, our message" rather than sounding like an organization. Content should be human-centered and relatable.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is a React-based single-page application built with TypeScript, utilizing functional components and hooks. Styling is managed with Tailwind CSS and the shadcn/ui component library. State management and caching for server data are handled by TanStack Query (React Query), while Wouter provides lightweight client-side routing. Form management leverages React Hook Form with Zod for type-safe validation. File uploads are integrated using Uppy.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js RESTful API server implemented in TypeScript. It includes middleware for logging, error handling, and request parsing. Database integration is managed via Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL. The system includes an abstracted storage interface with both in-memory and cloud storage capabilities. Development uses Vite for hot module replacement.

### Database Design
PostgreSQL is the primary database, accessed through Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries. The schema includes comprehensive fields for properties, covering location, specifications, legal compliance, and media storage. Data validation is ensured by shared Zod schemas between the frontend and backend, and Drizzle Kit is used for database schema migrations.

### API Structure
The API follows RESTful principles, providing standard CRUD operations for entities like properties. It supports advanced property search and filtering. Request validation is implemented using Zod schemas, and a centralized error handling system provides appropriate HTTP status codes.
